I did the home page, where it welcomes users to the site. In addition there is a button that says form that will take you to the form page where users are able to submit any fun facts they have about lilacs. I also did the form pages where users are able to submit fun facts about lilacs which they will get an alert saying it has been submitted. I also did the fun fact pages where there is nested routes. There are three fun facts about lilacs which then there is a read more button about that specific fun facts which take you to that page and more information which I created. The last thing I created is the Greek Mythology which tells the story of the God Pan. I also added the Fun Facts and Greek Mythology to the navigation
