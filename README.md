I did the home page, where it welcomes users to the site. In addition there is a button that says form that will take you to the form page where users are able to submit any fun facts they have about lilacs. I also did the form pages where users are able to submit fun facts about lilacs which they will get an alert saying it has been submitted. I also did the fun fact pages where there is nested routes. There are three fun facts about lilacs which then there is a read more button about that specific fun facts which take you to that page and more information which I created. The last thing I created is the Greek Mythology which tells the story of the God Pan. I also added the Fun Facts and Greek Mythology to the navigation

The three pages that I created were the Gardening, Guide, and FAQ pages. The Gardening page
displays general information about the subject along with some images. The Guide page contains 5 nested routes along with a layout.js file. The layout file for the nested routes displays a navigation that lets the user switch between "Caring for Lilacs" and "Common Problems with Lilacs." The "Caring for Lilacs" section has the remaining 4 nested routes that when clicked, take the user to the details page. This details page also contains a back button to 
allow the user to navigate back to where they were. The FAQ page has a question and answer
section for topics regarding gardening lilacs along with a form to submit any questions. When 
the user submits the form, a thank you message is briefly displayed. On the Home page, I added
the bottom section "View our Gardening Guide:" where the user can click to be redirected to "Caring for Lilacs" or "Common Problems with Lilacs" from the Guide page. Lastly, I added my pages to the navigation.
