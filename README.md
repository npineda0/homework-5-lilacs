I did the home page, where it welcomes users to the site. In addition there is a button that says form that will take you to the form page where users are able to submit any fun facts they have about lilacs. I also did the form pages where users are able to submit fun facts about lilacs which they will get an alert saying it has been submitted. I also did the fun fact pages where there is nested routes. There are three fun facts about lilacs which then there is a read more button about that specific fun facts which take you to that page and more information which I created. The last thing I created is the Greek Mythology which tells the story of the God Pan. I also added the Fun Facts and Greek Mythology to the navigation

I created the culture, uses, and gallery page. The culture page displays information about the diffrent symbolic meanings of lilacs and the different festivals theat are celebrated in north america. There is a button in the festivals section that leads you to a page that shows you when each festival is happening next. The uses pages displays a short paragraph of the ways lilacs are used. The gallery page is a where you can see images of lilacs but also add your own. On the home page I added a section that mentions the gallery page and encourages the user to to add their own.

## Naila
The three pages that I created were the Gardening, Guide, and FAQ pages. The Gardening page
displays general information about the subject along with some images. The Guide page contains 5 nested routes along with a layout.js file. The layout file for the nested routes displays a navigation that lets the user switch between "Caring for Lilacs" and "Common Problems with Lilacs." The "Caring for Lilacs" section has the remaining 4 nested routes that when clicked, take the user to the details page. This details page also contains a back button to 
allow the user to navigate back to where they were. The FAQ page has a question and answer
section for topics regarding gardening lilacs along with a form to submit any questions. When 
the user submits the form, a thank you message is briefly displayed. On the Home page, I added
the bottom section "View our Gardening Guide:" where the user can click to be redirected to "Caring for Lilacs" or "Common Problems with Lilacs" from the Guide page. Lastly, I added my pages to the navigation.
