        It is use as a poetic expression as a sense of nostalgia and the passing
        of time. Lilacs are known for their hardy nature and long life. Which
        they can live for over a 100 years. Since they live for a long time, if
        you are on a country road and see random lilac bush it is likely that a
        house or farm was once there.
